    <p>I would love to gain a lot of practice in application development. There have been a couple times where I have had ideas for personal websites or applications that I would like to build
    , but don't end up doing it because I don't yet have the necessary tools in my programming arsenal. I think it is a lot of fun to build and be creative, and so the more variety I can have in 
    my abilities, the more cool things I'll be able to do. I also hope to gain some proficiency in additional languages that will help me build my resume as I prepare for work.</p>
